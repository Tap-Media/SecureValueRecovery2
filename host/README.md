# SVR2 Host Code (the Go attempt)

This codebase provides a host-side binary for running and interacting with
an enclave, while also interacting with the outside world (external services,
clients, etc), and acts as a bridge between these two worlds.  It follows
typical Go paradigms.

## Go Version

Currently, this code is targetted to Go 1.19, so yay, generics are a thing.

## Testing

There should be some.

## Formatting

One `gofmt` to rule them all.
